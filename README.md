# Wigner3j6j9j

Calculators for the Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols,
relevant to angular momentum coupling in quantum physics.

* [3j symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-j_symbol) ![3j symbol](wigner3j.png "3j Symbol") - for two angular momenta

* [6j symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-j_symbol) ![6j symbol](wigner6j.png "6j Symbol") - for three angular momenta

* [9j symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-j_symbol) ![9j symbol](wigner9j.png "9j Symbol") - for four angular momenta

#### Instructions

To build the Java .jar archive, run Ant (on build.xml, by default).
```
ant
```

To launch a calculator, run its shell script.
```
wigner3j.sh
wigner6j.sh
wigner9j.sh
```
