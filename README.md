# Wigner3j6j9j

Calculators for the Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols,
relevant to angular momentum coupling in quantum physics.

Rewritten in JavaScript using BigInt, to enable accurate calculations for larger <i>j</i> values.
(The old Java version is in the `java` branch.)

#### Usage

See `wigner-3j6j9j.html` for an example of how to use the scripts, plus links to information about the 3j/6j/9j symbols.
